/// Represents a basic rectangular game object in 2D space.
///
/// This struct holds position, size, color, velocity, and a list of
/// dynamic components that can modify the object's behavior, similar
/// to Unity's component-based architecture.
///
/// Components can include physics (gravity, friction), input handling,
/// rendering, collision detection, etc.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// - `position`: The (x, y) coordinates of the top-left corner of the Quad.
/// - `size`: Width and height of the Quad.
/// - `color`: Color used to draw the Quad.
/// - `velocity_x`, `velocity_y`: Current velocity components along the X and Y axes.
/// - `components`: A vector of boxed components attached to this Quad.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// let mut quad = Quad::new(100.0, 200.0, 50.0, 50.0, WHITE);
/// quad.add_component(Box::new(Gravity::new(0.5)));
/// ```
